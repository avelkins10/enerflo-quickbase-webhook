## Recommendations

### 1. **Manual Data Entry Required**
These fields will need to be populated manually in QuickBase:
- Customer email and phone
- Project status and submission date
- Welcome call details
- Notes and comments
- Design validation information

### 2. **Alternative Data Sources**
Consider integrating with other systems to populate:
- Customer contact information (CRM, lead management)
- Project status updates (project management system)
- Welcome call data (call center system)
- Notes and comments (customer service system)

### 3. **File URL Generation**
The webhook provides file IDs and names, but not direct URLs. You may need to:
- Generate URLs using Enerflo's file API
- Store file references and generate URLs on-demand
- Implement a file proxy service

### 4. **Data Completeness Strategy**
- Focus on the 149 fields that ARE populated (69% of total)
- Implement data validation for critical missing fields
- Create workflows to capture missing data post-webhook
- Set up alerts for incomplete records

## Fields That ARE Populated (150 fields - 69.4%)

The webhook successfully provides data for:
- ✅ Deal and customer identification
- ✅ System specifications and equipment details
- ✅ Pricing and financial calculations
- ✅ Address and location information
- ✅ Design and array details
- ✅ Adders and additional work
- ✅ Utility and consumption data
- ✅ Financing product information
- ✅ State flags and checkboxes
- ✅ Sales team and organization data
- ✅ **Sales Notes** - Available at `deal.state['notes-comments']`

This represents a comprehensive data capture of the core solar project information.
